## Creating a data visualization dashboard for monitoring key metrics and performance indicators in a manufacturing plant

This project aims to design and implement an interactive data visualization dashboard that monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) in a manufacturing plant. 

The dashboard will provide multi-dimensional insights into metrics such as production output, machine utilization, downtime, and defect rates. By presenting this data in a clear and accessible format, the system could support operational decision-making, improve efficiency, and enable early detection of issues on the production floor.
